### 'Ello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Hacktix alias Optixâ„¢ and sometimes I program things that work. I've discovered my enthusiasm for the topic of emulation and retro consoles, so that's a big part of what I do. In fact, here's some cool projects that I have worked or am working on:

- [TixBoy,](https://github.com/Hacktix/TixBoy) a Web-based Nintendo Gameboy Emulator
- [TixTest-GB,](https://github.com/Hacktix/TixTest-GB) a repository of Gameboy Hardware Test ROMs written in Assembly
- [GB-8,](https://github.com/Hacktix/GB-8) a CHIP-8 Interpreter written in Assembly for the Gameboy Color
- [Tixty4,](https://github.com/Hacktix/Tixty4) a heavily WIP Nintendo 64 Emulator
- [TixNES,](https://github.com/Hacktix/TixNES) a just as much WIP Web-based NES Emulator

A lot of the time when I'm not working on Emulators I'm contributing to emulation-related open-source documentations such as [hardware.inc for the Gameboy](https://github.com/gbdev/hardware.inc) or the [Gameboy Pandocs](https://github.com/gbdev/pandocs), as well as my own Gameboy-related blog [GBEDG](https://github.com/Hacktix/GBEDG).
